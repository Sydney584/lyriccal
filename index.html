    <h2>OMG What Are the Words to that Song?</h2>
    <p>Have you ever found yourself singing along to a song and making up your own words?<br>
        Or maybe you just don't even know the words!<br>
    I hate to admit it but so have I often just made up my own lyrics!!<br>
    I just make it up as I go along sometimes!<br>
    But thanks to the internet, Google and some diligent folks, you don't have to keep singing the wrong lyrics to your favorite tunes!
